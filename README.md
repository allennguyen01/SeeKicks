# Brief description
Every sneakerhead has been in the situation where they see a unique shoe out in public and they desperately want to know what the name of the shoe is. 
The only method to find out what shoe it is is to type our observations on Google, but with over hundreds of brands and thousands of shoe models it is 
likely we do not end up with what we were searching for. To solve this problem, we have come up with the idea to create a mobile app called SeeKicks. 
SeeKicks takes a photo of the unidentified sneakers and uses machine learning classification to identify up to 899 different sneaker models. SeeKicks 
can identify sneakers from brands like Nike, Jordan, Adidas, New Balance, Asics, Vans, and many more. Once the shoe is classified, the app will open up
its corresponding StockX link, a popular marketplace that shows the current price and details of sneakers.
